## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```
A1. 3) There is a growth for almost all the capitals other than Darwin. A decay can be seen for Darwin. A rapid increase can be seen for Sydney - Wollongong (This may be possible since Sydney is not separated from Wollongong, but according to my assumption, this looks good). Brisbane looks more consistent when compared to the other capitals.

A2 4. 

a. "Which region’s population overtakes that of another region in the same state/territory?
In which year/s does this happen?"
Answer: To get insight on the region's data becomes difficult to extract from the given data since there is no enough information on which region belongs to which state exactly. Hence, I have included the option to choose the regions on the right side of the motion chart so that the user can select the desired locations and check the trend. 


b. "Is there generally a relationship between the Indigenous Australian population size and
percentage of children in the population? If so, what kind of relationship? Explain
your answer."
Answer: As the years increase, we can see that the population is increasing, but the percentage of children decreases until around 2028. And then it picks up from there and increase till 2031. 

c. "Color is commonly used in data visualization to help understand data. Which aspect of
this data would you use color for in your plot and why?"
Answer: Selecting percentage(y-axis) values for color makes sense to me since any change on the population(x-axis) changes the values on percentage(y-axis) and this will make the color go from red to blue (red being the highest and blue being the lowest), increase/decrease in the percentage can be easily visualized. 

d. "Are there any other interesting things you notice in the data or any changes you would
recommend for the Motion Chart? "
Answer: The original question for Motion chart did not ask me to consider the "Year" column for the Motion chart. But I took the liberty of adding the Year column in the motion chart since that made more sense to me. So adding the Year column makes the motion chart look more appealing
